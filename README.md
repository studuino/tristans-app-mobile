	$ npm install -g ionic cordova jsdoc

Clone the repo (or pull)

Navigate to the repo folder and run

	$ npm install

Install the ionic devapp for testing https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/devapp (Optional)

Read everything in /docs

## Before Pushing

1. Update all relevant documentation in the JSDoc strings
2. Make sure it works and builds without failing lol
2. run `npm run lint` to check if code is clean
