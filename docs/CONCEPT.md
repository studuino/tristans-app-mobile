# Meme App

### What is this meme app

The idea is to provide a utility for consumers to create meme's out of each other and a networking service for consumers to create memes out of people from their extended social circles and local community. The application will feature a "points" system that rewards the best meme creators and will serve to frame the application as a "social media game". Influence points increases your rankings in several search and indexing features. A leaderboard system should drastically increase addiction and engagement.

The meme app will have a global index which will show memes from posters who have marked their posts as "Public". The global index will try its best to show the most relevant content (based on location, following, most popular etc).

### Growth Strategy

The early adopters will likely be young teens from 11 - 16 years old with variable popularity among 17+ y/o's

#### Case 1
Initial growth attempts may be made by using close social circles to join the app and use it as a means for creating private memes from inside jokes, this could establish something of a critical mass for others to join if our engagement strategy holds

#### Case 2
A user will see a link in a group chat (**Assumption 2.1**) asking users to meme an image from that group (hopefully the image involves known friends). The link will redirect the user to a page which display the original image with the meme's of other users. The user will see the content and want in on the action (**Assumption 2.2**), the user will be notified that to get in on the action they need to create an account (can be made a popup to speed up sign up). When the user signs up they are able to make their meme. The user will create the meme and be interested if their meme wins, therefore wanting to be notified (**Assumption 2.3**). The user will be prompted upon meme submission to install app, and when notified via email about the results closing will be encouraged to install app, at this point the user will install the app (**Assumption 2.4**)

#### Case 3
Users will see a meme in a group and will be interested about who made it (**Assumption 3.1**), the users will tell them about the app or the user will see the potential watermark. The user will navigate to the website or app and love it, will install the app (**Assumption 3.2**)

#### Case 4
Users will see an ad from Facebook, SEO and/or an influencer and will download the app (**Assumption 4.1**)
  * Presenting a funny meme and encouraging users to view the home feed of the service (will require a small existing user base to be successful)

### Engagement Strategy

* Personalized push notifications (emails if app not installed)
  * Notified when friends upload images of you
  * Invitations from friends to "meme" something
* Point system where you "level up" in influence
* Can be a playground for those with humor and not appearance (like Instagram)
* Leaderboard system -> compete with friends!
  * Weekly leaderboard system, global, regional and network
  * Need to make it like a creative competition, the big players will keep coming back to increase "clout"
  * Need to win prizes from "influence points"

### Selling Points
  
  * **Funny** content
  * Showing content that is local and from friends increases sense of **community**
  * Take on a **new role** from your day to day life
  * Builds off **growing trends** from apps like Vine and Tic Toc but brings more community to it
  * The concept is based off **established games** like Jackbox party games

### Random Thoughts

* Allow users to input their image location to increase community feel
* Make sure we **NAIL** the push notifications to keep users **COMING BACK**
  * Consider a push notification that notifies user of new friends on the service
  * Consider a push notification that emphasizes other friends beating them in score
* Need to implement video features ASAP after traction is gained
* Creating memes will be most fun if it involves **FRIENDS** or **KNOWN PEOPLE** or **COMMUNITY**

* The growth strategy and engagement strategy needs to have stats collected
  * Collect data on most interesting push notification
  * Collect data on where most traffic comes from (SEO, FB, Influencer endorsements, Various Social Media Pages)

### Key points to nail

* Meme generator (make sure a bit of variety and new ways of making jokes)
  * It is key that the meme's allow for the users to take on a new "role" from their ordinary life
  * Perhaps user can upload their own images and append them to the original, or download the image and do more complex "memeing"
* Initial growth strategy, once content and critical userbase is established we Gucci
* Getting users to download the native app
