# Meme App

### Hypothetical Use Case

On first exposure to the service the user should be met with a feed of the best locally generated content (even better if the content is from their friends). _This is why it is vital the service require the user to join with their FB account._

The service will only let the user view publicly available content in the "home feed" until they sign up with their Facebook account.

To sign up they will click a button or be prompted when committing an illegal action. The Facebook login will stress that no sensitive information will be released or accessed and that they need to provide an alias that their friends will know (like snapchat and Instagram)

Upon signup the user will see content optimized for them by their friends / from their nearby location. The user will be prompted to upload their own image and choose whether their friends or the general public are allowed to "meme it" (need a trademark name for this action). Additionally we may allow people to upload funny standalone meme's to start getting content on the service.

* If the user chooses for their friends to meme it they can decide whether all of them can meme it or if only a selection can. If specific friends are selected they will receive a push notification saying that a friend "invited them to meme a photo they uploaded". The users have three hours to create a joke from it, afterwards the users asks if they would like to make the meme public or private.

* If the user chooses public, then the meme is uploaded to the global index for the public to do it's bidding, after three hours the meme is uploaded to the global pool of memes

When users find an image from a user they can decide to upvote it **and** provide their modified meme version. They can also decide to upvote other meme'd versions of the image that they like. After three hours the meme is archived and added to the global meme pool, where other users are free to upvote the best meme, when the card containing the meme is focused the user can see the runner up's.

When users upvote meme's and images, the host user is awarded points and will go up in level. The user will receive push notification's when they go up in level and will act as a reward system to maintain engagement.

### Growth Strategy

The early adopters will likely be young teens from 11 - 16 years old with variable popularity among 17+ y/o's

* Initial growth attempts may be made by using close social circles to join the app and use it as a means for creating private memes from inside jokes, this could establish something of a critical mass for others to join if our engagement strategy holds
* A user may see a locally generated meme on a Facebook page or chat group and _should_ be curious about **who** created it / **where** it came from -> therefore seeking our service without assistance
* Can fund advertisements on FB, presenting a funny meme and encouraging users to view the home feed of the service (will require a small existing user base to be successful).

The user will navigate to our web page and see a public listing of all community made memes along with the runner ups for each when focused (clicked). The concept of the app along with existing content from community and friends will hopefully lead to the user to download the app from the Play Store / App Store.


### Engagement Strategy

* Personalized push notifications
* Point system where you "level up" in influence
* Can be a playground for those with humor and not appearance (like Instagram)

### Selling Points

* **Funny** content
* Showing content that is local and from friends increases sense of **community**
* Builds off **growing trends** from apps like Vine and Tic Toc but brings more community to it
* The concept is based off **established games** like Jackbox party games
